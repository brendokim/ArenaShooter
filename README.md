# ArenaShooter

ArenaShooter is a simple shooter game developed using Unreal Engine 5. Inspired by other popular games like Counter Strike and Valorant, ArenaShooter focuses on precise gunplay and movement to defeat foes. It is currently a work in progress.

# Purpose
This project is for me to explore and learn the fundamentals of UE5, which I had never used before.
Throughout the development of ArenaShooter, I gained experience with:

- UE5 Blueprints for visual scripting
- Basic skeletal animation and modeling techniques
- Character control and gameplay mechanics

Feel free to explore, learn, and enjoy the process of game development with ArenaShooter!
